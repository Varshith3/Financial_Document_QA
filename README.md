# ðŸ“Š Financial Presentation RAG Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end pipeline to extract structured and unstructured information from financial presentation PDFs (e.g., investor presentations, earnings reports) and enables intelligent querying through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system integrates OCR, SQL storage, vector embedding, and an LLM-powered query interface.
